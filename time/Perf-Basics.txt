performance testing 
#perf

gather information about which subroutines consume the most time, in kernel in library in a program
sudo perf record find /-xdev -name core >/dev/null 2>&1
sudo perf report

Response time 

   minimum
        -> a response as fast as possible
   deterministic
        -> a response in the same amount of time, every time
   deadline
        -> a response in time-earlier may not have any additional value
       
       
Throughput
         Throughput tells you how much data was transferred from a source at any given time
         and bandwidth tells you how much data could theoretically be transferred from a source at any given time
         
         database transactions per seconds
         webpages served per minutes
         bytes transferred per second
         throughput and response time may compete
         
        
completion time
            a particular task that completes as soon as possible
            
            sw builds
            qa run

real(total time took to run)
